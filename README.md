# bb7x2
Exploratory enumeration of some 7-state 2-symbol Turing machines. We are running [mxdys's code](https://github.com/ccz181078/TM), followed by [Shawn and Terry's code](https://github.com/sligocki/busy-beaver). See the [wiki article](https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/BB(7)) on BB(7) for the overall progress of this.

I will upload results as file attachments in releases.
